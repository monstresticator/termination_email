# Termination Email 

This is a simple form used to send managers a prewritten email message about users who have been terminated.

The form will include the manager's email address in the To: field of chosen default email program, the terminated employee's name in the subject line and in the body's message.

Any assets not turned in by the ex-employee will be listed below the message by asset name and description.
